# linear_regression_diamonds

What makes one diamond more expensive than the other? I plan to answer this question using linear regression. 
Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a response and predictor(s). 
I applied this modeling process on a Diamond dataset to create a model that infers the price based on the physical properties (predictors) of each diamond. 
The final model also suggests which predictors are most significant in predicting the price.
