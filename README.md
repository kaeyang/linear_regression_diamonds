# linear_regression_diamonds

What makes one diamond more expensive than the other? I plan to answer this question using linear regression. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a response and predictor(s). I applied this modeling process on a Diamond dataset to create a model that infers the price based on the physical properties (predictors) of each diamond. The final model also suggests which predictors are most significant in predicting the price.

I find that the model ‘log(Price) ~ log(Carat) + Color + Depth + Table’ is the best model for determining the price of a diamond. I also consider the two versions of this model to highlight the differences that occur when keeping or discarding the influential points found at the beginning of our process. When I exclude the influential data points from our model, I see a reduction in the heteroscedasticity problem of the residuals; however, ultimately, the sample size of this data set is still substantial enough for the statistical tests of the predictors to hold true. For the model containing the influential points, the adjusted R-squared is 0.947, and for the model without them, the adjusted R-squared is 0.952, meaning that in both cases, the goodness of fit of the model is quite high.
